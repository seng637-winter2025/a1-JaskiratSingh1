# Introduction

Before this lab, we learned about exploratory and manual functional testing in our lectures. In the lab, we applied these techniques to test the ATM software’s main functions like withdrawals and deposits. This experience helped us understand how to find and report issues effectively through hands-on practice.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

We will target the main functions: cash withdrawal, deposits, money transfers, balance inquiries, transaction cancellation, and receipt printing. Using a breadth-first approach, we will test all these functions lightly to understand the overall system behavior. This includes performing typical transactions like withdrawals, deposits, and transfers to ensure basic operations work correctly.
Each of our group member will use roughly half an hour to test and will explore different transaction flows and document any observations or issues we find.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

- Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
  system, containing all defects recorded in the system.
